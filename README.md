# JenkinsPipelineIntegration

## How do I use this myself?

To create a build.gradle for your own Jenkins instance, use the generate-gradle-build.groovy script in your Jenkin's groovy script console. After that, you just add your own tests + shared library steps!

To run the tests, run `./script/test integrationTests` and `./script/test docCheck`
